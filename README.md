- **runMe.m**: The main assignment file. This can be executed to generate all results for this assignment.
- **IKcost.m**: This function implements the cost function used by fmincon (**part1.m** **part2.m**) to solve for IK.
- **updateSnakeBotDrawing.m**: Refreshes 3D snake robot graphics.
- **part1.m**: Solution to part 1 of the assignment, using fmincon to solve for IK on the snake robot, with hard constraints for the joint limits and obstacle collisions. Cost function gradient and hessian not used here. Graphics are refreshed during runtime to show incremental optimization results.
- **part2.m**: Solution to part 2 of the assignment. Virtually the same as part 1, except for the use of a cost function gradient by the fmincon optimizer.
